        <textarea placeholder="Design will evolve into a seamless fusion of emotion, technology, and sustainability, where every pixel and product tells a story. As creators, we’ll shift from simply solving problems to crafting experiences that resonate deeply with human values. The future of design is not just visual, it's intuitive, inclusive, and alive with purpose.

In the future, we’ll see more creative ways to mix digital and real-life experiences. Whether it’s in art, fashion, or web design, people will focus more on making things that feel personal and meaningful.

        <textarea placeholder="To me, designs will always evolve in the most unexpected ways, yet will still be appreciated by many. You never know that a certain type of color or a certain type of pattern will start becoming popular, no matter how many people try to predict it. Yes, there can be good and bad types of designs, but there is no doubt there are at least a few people out there who will appreciate it. As designers, it is crucial for us to carefully incorporate them in our work to convey the intended message properly

From the bright colors and bold lines of Pop Art to today’s modern styles, creativity and technology will continue to work together.
